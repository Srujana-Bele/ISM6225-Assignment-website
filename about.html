        <h2>About Me &#128512</h2>
        <p>My name is <b>Srujana Bele</b>, the developer of this website. I am currently pursuing an MS in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida, Tampa. This is my first time developing a website, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I have committed myself to creating a user-friendly platform where all Bollywood movies can be viewed in one place.</p>

I have learned and applied my knowledge to design a user-friendly and professional website. From designing user interfaces with HTML and CSS to implementing dynamic functionality with JavaScript, each step taught me something new.</p>
