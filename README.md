The "One Stop-Bollywood Movies" website is an interactive and user-friendly platform that brings together a number of features to improve the user experience. The website provides all the necessary features for a Bollywood movie fan, including trending movie exploration, creating a personalized wishlist, and submitting reviews.The data visualization page further adds value by providing insights into user interactions and preference. 

We have used HTML to create the structure of various web pages and CSS to style the webpages and responsiveness. Java script is used to handle crud operations ( read, update, delete,add), tracking clicks, processing payments. For creating Visual representation of data I have used chart.js which performs analytics.
